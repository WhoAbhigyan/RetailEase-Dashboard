# RetailEase-Dashboard

**Tagline:** Affordable, AI-assisted shop management system for small businesses

---

## Overview
RetailEase-Dashboard is a **smart kiosk and dashboard system** designed for small shop owners, local bakeries, caf√©s, and restaurants to manage billing, inventory, and sales reports efficiently. Most small businesses rely on manual registers, which often causes pricing errors, stock mismanagement, and inaccurate GST calculations. This platform provides a **digital-first, user-friendly solution** that automates daily operations and offers actionable insights.

This project was **developed entirely with guidance from OpenAI GPT-5**, which assisted in system design, frontend and backend coding, database structuring, reporting logic, and UI/UX planning. GPT-5 acted as an AI assistant throughout, enabling a single developer to build a complete, functional system efficiently.
